This code is based on the original Javascript suncalc by Vladimir Agafonkin ("mourner").  I also used the Java port by Nolan Caudill ("mncaudill") for ideas.  Where these two diverged, I tried to stick with the original.  This Objective C port for iOS implements and passes the same tests as the original.
